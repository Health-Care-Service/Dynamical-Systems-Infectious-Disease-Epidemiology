#Vector-borne ID transmission


## Overview and Learning Objectives
In this chapter, we will discuss an important form of indirect transmission, one that has a vector stage.

The learning objectives for this chapter are:
* Know about important IDs that are vector-borne
* Understand the implactions of vector-borne transmission on ID dynamics 
* Understand how vector-borne transmission influences potential ID control strategies.


## Introduction
Vector-borne ID are those that go through - at least - two different hosts to complete a full replication and transmission cycle. Hosts of one type infect hosts of the other, there is no direct transmission between hosts of the same type.

Not surprisingly, the IDs which receive the most study are those where one of the hosts are humans. The other host (i.e. the vector) can be any other animal, such as dogs, rodents, snails, insects, etc. At times, growth and replication of the pathogen occur mainly in one host, with the other just serving as vessel to get between hosts. Most often, the pathogen completes important parts of its growth and replication cycle in both (or all, if there are more than 2) hosts.



###Vector-borne transmission and ID patterns
Understanding what mechanisms lead to potentially observed patterns in incidence and prevalence for vector-borne diseases is difficult, due to the presence of more than one host. In a previous chapter, we discussed cycles that could be caused by the intrinsic transmission dynamics or influenced by external drivers (e.g. seasonal changes in weather). This general concept still holds, but there are now 2 species (e.g. humans and mosquitos), both with their own intrinsic dynamics and responding differently to external factors. This adds complexity. Nevertheless, patterns in ID dynamics are often observed for vector-borne diseases, and at least partially understood. For instance, the reproductive cycle of mosquitos strongly depends on the weather, and specifically the availability or lack of water. As such, in regions that have strong differences in rainfall between seasons, one often observes annual cycles based on annual weather patterns. 


###Vector-borne transmission and interventions
With vector-borne ID, there is a unique opportunity for interventions that does not exist for directly transmitted diseases. Namely, we can try to control the ID at the vector stage. That often means trying to kill as many vectors as possible. DDT in the past, and more recently pesticide-coated bednets have been proven to work very effectively. Unfortunately, these interventions need to be sustained, otherwise mosquito numbers (or other vectors with a short life-span) quickly bounce back. Also, while we mostly think of mosquitos and other insects as nuisance or worse, they do perform important roles in the ecosystem, and it is unclear what the consequences would be of potentially killing all Aenopheles mosquitos (the ones that transmit a lot of important ID). Some recent approaches try to make mosquitos resistant to ID. If one could introduce those and have them outcompete the mosquitos that are susceptible to the ID, one might - in theory - get rid of important IDs without affecting the ecosystem in unpredictable ways. 

A major problem with all control startegies targeting vectors is that not only do pathogens evolve quickly, but most vectors have fairly short lifespans and large population numbers, which means rapid evolution. This could make any control measures ineffective within a number of years. Indeed, that was observed for DDT, where mosquitos resistant to the chemical started to appear before its widespread use was discontinued.


##Modeling vector-borne transmission {myadvancedbox}
The easiest way to model a vector-borne disease is to simply ignore the vector and assume that the transmission term of the equation (e.g. a term like _bSI_) represents -- in a very simpliefied form -- all the complicated processes involved in transmission, including the vector stage. That makes the model simple, but of course doesn't capture the vector-borne aspects of the dynamics. If we are interested in the dynamics of the disease in all hosts, we do need to include the vector components in a model. To include vectors in a model, one could for instance build 2 SIR-type models, with one set of equations for the (human) host and one for the vector, and then couple the compartments by including transmission from humans to vectors and vectors to humans. Equations for such a model might look as follows:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot S_h &= - \beta_1 S_h I_v \\
\dot I_h &= \beta_1S_h I_v - \gamma_h I_h \\
\dot R_h &= \gamma_h I_h \\
\dot S_v &= - \beta_2 S_v I_h \\
\dot I_v &= \beta_2 S_v I_h - \gamma_v I_v \\
\dot R_v &= \gamma_v I_v
\end{aligned}
$$
Here, the index _h_ indicates humans and _v_ indicates vectors. The important vector-borne aspect of such a model is that transmission only occurs from hosts to vector and vector to host, not between hosts or vectors. In general, the above model needs to be modified to more accurately describe vector-borne ID dynamics. For instance, many vectors have a fairly short natural lifespan, and as such their births and deaths need to be included in the model, even if the timescale on which we investigate the model is short enough to allow us to ignore births and deaths for (human) hosts. It is common to include more details in the human part of the model (e.g. asymptomatic stage and others as discussed previously) and less detail for the vector part. The specific details that should be included are driven by the question one wants to to study.



##Summary and Cartoon




##Exercises
* The _Vector transmission_ app in the DSAIDE package provides hands-on computer exercises for this chapter.
* Nominate an ID as contender for having the 'craziest or most complicated' mode(s) of transmission. Explain the transmission dynamics for your nomination and justify why it deserves the title of _craziest or most complicated_. This doesn't have to be a vector-borne disease, though some of the "crazy" ones tend to use multiple hosts.
