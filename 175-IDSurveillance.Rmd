# Infectious Disease Surveillance


## Overview and Learning Objectives
In this module, we will take a look at surveillance of different infectious diseases.


The learning objectives for this chapter are:

* Understand surveillance 


##Introduction
To be able to implement successful interventions, we first need to know what is actually happening. Once we implemented a control strategy, we also want to know how it works. For both of those goals, good surveillance is key.


##Goals of Surveillance

* Identify new emerging diseases as quickly as possible

##Types of Surveillance
Active and passive

Medical/clinical and sequence

Ongoing or ad-hoc

##Problems with surveillance
Knowing numerator and denominator. Bias due to getting more severe cases. Behavior change during an outbreak.
