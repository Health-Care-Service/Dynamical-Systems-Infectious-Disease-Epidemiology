# Appendix B - How to build or use the right model {#modelcomplexity}


Onee might be inclined to build very complicated and detailed models, in an effort to be as realistic as possible. While more detailed models can indeed be more realistic, there are several drawbacks. First, as models get larger, they contain more parameters. Each parameter needs to be given a numeric value to allow one to run simulations. One can try to obtain the parameters from the literature, however, often that information is not available. Alternatively, one could fit the model to data (something not discussed in this book) and try to estimate the parameters. However, with the kind of data typically available, one can usually only estimate a few parameters with some level of certainty. And even if one were to be able to get good estimates for all model parameters, larger models are harder to implement, take longer to run, and are more difficult to analyze. With too many parts present, it can be hard to understand how different components interact with each other and affect outcomes of interest. 

We therefore cannot - and do not want to - include every detail of a complex system, i.e. all components and interactions. We need to decide which parts are important and need to be in the model, and which ones we can ignore. A simple and somewhat silly example: We never include the hair color of individuals in any infectious disease models (at least I've never seen such a model), since we assume that this characteristic is not important for the ID dynamics. The choice to include or exclude other features is less obvious in other cases. For instance, for an HIV model, we likely need gender, while a SARS model might ignore this characteristic. 

It is important to find a trade-off between details that need to be included and details one can leave out. Unfortunately, there is no recipe for it. Some very simple models have produced useful insights, while there are big models in the literature that arguably do little to nothing in helping us understand or deal with infectious diseases. Obviously, there have also been fairly big models that have produced useful information, and small models that are too simplistic to provide much information about any real system.

A good analogy for model building and use in general is the use of maps. Maps are models of the real world. They serve specific purposes, and it is important that a given map be useful for the intended purpose. For instance, if we want to know how to drive from Atlanta to Athens, the left map in figure \@ref(fig:mapfigure) would be most useful. If instead we want to know where in the US the state of Georgia is located, the middle map is most useful. If we want to know where most people live in Georgia, the right map is most useful. In each case, we study the same object (the state of Georgia), but depending on the question, different maps are needed. Maps (and models) are useful because they capture the information that is needed for a specific situation, while leaving out unneccesary information. Nobody would want to have a map so detailed that it is essentially the real world - it wouldn't be a very useful map anymore.


```{r mapfigure,  fig.cap='Three different maps of the state of Georgia.', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/mapfigure.png")
```

In analogy to the map example, we need to decide for a specific ID, scenario, and question which details to include in our model and which ones to ignore. In general, the primary interactions between components of the system are needed. Thus, if we wanted to model the transmission dynamics of Ebola, we might need to include deceased infected individuals into the model, since they are known to contribute to transmission. In contrast, if we want to study how some control strategies for SARS might reduce the total number of *infected* but we don't care about the impact on total deaths (unlikely, but let's just pretend). In this case, we would not need a dead compartment in our model, since those dead don't further interact with anyone else in the system. However, if we want to keep track of deaths and how they are impacted by our intervention (likely), we do need to track them - even though dead people are not known to transmit SARS. 

To build models that are suitable to study a particular system, model builders need to be experts on the system they want to study or collaborate with subject matter experts. Building a good model needs to follow the [Goldilocks Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle): If a model is too simple, it likely doesn't approximate the real system very well. If the model is too complicated, it is hard to build and analyze, and might not lead to much insight (i.e. the model is a big black box). The goal is to get the model _just right_ regarding size and complexity. Unfortunately, no recipe or formula exists specifying how to build a _just right_ model. Using models that are suitable for a given system and question is a hallmark of a good scientist.

The model building and analysis process is often iterative. After a model has been built and studied, it might become clear -- e.g. by comparing the model with data -- that important components or interactions have been ignored or not been included correctly. This leads to model modification and refinement. This back and forth between model and data/the real world can happen over multiple iterations.


Note that for purposes of teaching, we keep the models throughout this book fairly simple. The models will include the feature we are focusing on while excluding others. For instance, we include humans and mosquitos for vector-borne IDs but ignore things like asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic states. This is mainly done to keep models simple and focus on one feature at a time. Models that address "real" questions often -- but not always -- include more details than the models we investigate througout this book.
