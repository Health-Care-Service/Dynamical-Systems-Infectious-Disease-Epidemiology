# Dynamics of Multiple Pathogens

##Overview and Learning Objectives
In this chapter, we will discuss a scenario where more than one infectious disease is considered simultaneously.


The learning objectives for this chapter are:

* 

##Introduction
So far, we focused on a single ID.




##Interactions of ID



##Multiple ID and control
While the importance of interactions between IDs is recognized, a multi-ID approach to intervention is often not as common as it probably should be.


##Modeling multiple ID
The approach to modeling multiple ID is similar to that of host heterogeneity: We need to split/stratify the population according to infection status of each ID. The complicated bits are to properly model any potential interactions between IDs.

As mentioned previously, more compartments means bigger models. Those are harder to write, more difficult to analyze, and we need estimates for each model parameter, which are often hard to get. Because of that, considering/modeling more than 2 ID is still almost never done - but many important 2-ID modeling studies exist.



##Summary and Cartoon
This module provided a brief discussion of multi-pathogen systems.
