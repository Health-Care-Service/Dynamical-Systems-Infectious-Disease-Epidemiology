<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.2</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Evolution is based on the generation of diversity, usually genetic diversity through mutations and the subsequent increase or decrease in certain genetic variants through selection or random drift. Microorganisms, especially viruses, tend to undergo rapid evolutionary change. High mutation rates and large population sizes provide many opportunities for the generation of genotypic and phenotypic diversity. Short generation times and fluctuations in population size (e.g., through transmission bottlenecks) allow selection to quickly act on this diversity, amplifying those mutants that have a fitness advantage and eliminating those with low fitness. These features of microbial populations often lead to rapid evolutionary changes. Such evolutionary change can become a public health problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="emergence-and-evolution" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.3</span> Emergence and Evolution</h2>
<p>For infectious diseases, you will often hear the term <em>emergence</em> as in <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em>. This means the ID is in some way new to a population, either never seen in a particular host before (e.g., SARS emergence in 2003 in humans) or a disease that emerges in a new location. The pathogen can either be an entirely new type (e.g., SARS, MERS) or a variant of an existing one (e.g., a new strain of influenza or norovirus, or a drug-resistant form of a bacteria). Emergence describes the observed phenomenon. Almost always in such cases, some evolution occurs. For instance, a pathogen that is already in the human population evolves drug resistance. Or a new pathogen is introduced into the human population and then undergoes evolution to adapt to the new host. While one could define emergence as the phenomenon and evolution as the mechanism, in practice, you will often find these terms used interchangeably, and the exact meaning will depend on how the author defines it. In this chapter, we will discuss both the mechanisms of evolution and how they can lead to the emergence of new pathogens. The ability to understand and predict the emergence of new IDs is, of course, of vital importance, recent references providing additional information are <span class="citation">(Brett, Drake, and Rohani <a href="#ref-brett17">2017</a>; Dibble et al. <a href="#ref-dibble16">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="ecological-drivers-of-evolution-and-emergence" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.4</span> Ecological drivers of evolution and emergence</h2>
<p>Many external, ecological factors affect ID dynamics. Weather, climate, vegetation, the abundance and density of hosts and other species, nutritional status, and general living conditions are all important factors influencing human and animal ID. This is true both for short-term dynamics (e.g., weather patterns can affect disease incidence) as well as for the long-term evolutionary dynamics. The emergence of many new viral pathogens among humans (e.g., HIV, SARS, MERS) is likely caused by the closer contact humans have with the animals who are the main hosts of those diseases. Transmission in these situations of close human-animal contact is often called spillover. Similarly, as discussed in the previous chapter, measles and other diseases were only able to emerge and establish themselves among humans once human populations became large enough. As global warming will affect climate and as people become more affluent and urbanized, we can expect further changes in ID dynamics and evolution over the next decades - though predicting what changes exactly will occur, and which diseases might increase and decrease in importance is very difficult <span class="citation">(Altizer et al. <a href="#ref-altizer13">2013</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="evolution-and-immune-escape" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.5</span> Evolution and Immune Escape</h2>
<p>A powerful driver of evolution is the host immune response. If an ID induces a strong immune response which subsequently protects the host from re-infection, a mutant of the ID which can partially escape the host immunity and infect a host will have a large fitness advantage. This is the process which drives the continuous evolution of influenza in humans. It is likely also the driver for changes in many other diseases, especially viruses. Why some pathogens do not seem to evolve much to circumvent immune response (measles is a good example) is not quite clear, though some studies have speculated on that topic <span class="citation">(Frank and Bush <a href="#ref-frank07">2007</a>; Lange and Ferguson <a href="#ref-lange09">2009</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="public-health-interventions-and-evolution" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.6</span> Public Health Interventions and Evolution</h2>
<p>Some of the most potent drivers of evolution are in fact public health interventions that try to reduce the burden of an ID. The more powerful the intervention (e.g., vaccines or drugs), the more evolutionary pressure a pathogen faces and the more advantaged a pathogen variant that is partially or entirely resistant to the intervention will be. The following sections briefly discuss several drivers of public health importance that influence the selective fitness of different genetic variants and thereby drive ID-evolution.</p>
<div id="evolution-of-immunity-or-vaccine-escape" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">14.6.1</span> Evolution of Immunity or Vaccine Escape</h3>
<p>Vaccines are some of our most potent interventions. Vaccination induces immunity in the vaccinated hosts. If a pathogen can circumvent immunity and infected vaccinated individuals, it will have a large fitness advantage. Therefore, any mutation that arises which allows a pathogen to reduce the impact of host immunity will likely spread through a population quickly. Most immunity works through antibodies. Thus pathogen variants that evolve not to be (or less) recognized by pre-existing antibodies have an advantage. This is the same mechanism induced by natural immunity. Thus, pathogens that frequently evolve to escape natural antibody-based immunity (e.g., influenza, HIV) are also able to develop resistance to vaccine-induced immunity. This is the reason we need to get re-immunized with influenza vaccines regularly and why we have not managed to develop an HIV vaccine. In contrast, an ID like measles which does not seem to be able to escape natural immunity also does not evolve resistance to the vaccine, and we can use the same vaccine against measles we have been using for decades.</p>
<p>The reason why measles might not be able to escape binding by pre-existing antibodies is likely because the binding site is also the part of the virus that is needed to attach to and enter host cells. Any mutation evading antibody binding would also lead to an inability to attach to and infect cells. In contrast, for influenza, the antibody binding regions and the receptor attachment regions are somewhat distinct.</p>
</div>
<div id="evolution-of-drug-resistance" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">14.6.2</span> Evolution of Drug Resistance</h3>
<p>Drugs are another mechanism that applies a strong selective pressure. Any pathogen that can avoid being killed by a drug can potentially ‘take over’ a patient and transmit to the next. If drug use is widespread in the population, those resistant mutants which generally have lower fitness than the wild-type, drug-sensitive strain can take over in a population. This phenomenon has been observed with many different ID and drugs and produced such looming public health problems as extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) <span class="citation">(Levy and Marshall <a href="#ref-levy04">2004</a>)</span>. Since viruses tend to evolve faster than bacteria, drug resistance evolution is often a problem at the individual patient level. HIV is the prime example. Single-drug therapy for HIV fails consistently because the virus quickly evolved resistance. Only once we started using multiple drugs at the same time were we able to prevent rapid evolution. We are playing a ‘numbers game’ since the chance of 3 resistance mutations against 3 different drugs occurring is so small that it rarely happens during the treatment of an individual host, thus making the drugs effective for the host’s lifetime. Since drug resistance is such an important public health problem, it is widely studied. This includes many modeling studies. For an overview of some of those, see <span class="citation">(Louz et al. <a href="#ref-louz10">2010</a>; Temime et al. <a href="#ref-temime08">2008</a>; Wiesch et al. <a href="#ref-wiesch11">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="evolution-of-virulence" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.7</span> Evolution of Virulence</h2>
<p>The term virulence is a bit fuzzy, but it generally means ‘harm to the host’. That could be due to mortality caused by an ID, or in less severe forms, ID-related morbidity (sickness/symptoms). Pathogens ‘don’t care’ about harming their hosts, their primary ‘purpose’ is to get in, replicate, and get back out and infect the next host. Sometimes, inducing some morbidity in the host is useful for the pathogen. Sneezing and coughing for respiratory infections might lead to enhanced transmission and therefore increased pathogen fitness. In other situations, inducing morbidity/mortality doesn’t increase pathogen fitness, but it also doesn’t decrease it. Therefore, selection doesn’t act to change the number of symptoms induced. Pathogens that are too virulent, and in extreme cases kill their hosts, generally have reduced fitness since, in most situations, dead hosts do not transmit. The idea is then that pathogens evolve to induce the level of virulence that is optimal for their overall transmission fitness.</p>
</div>
<div id="evolution-and-public-health-interventions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.8</span> Evolution and Public Health Interventions</h2>
<p>In general (apart from the possible phenomenon of drug-induced hypermutation in bacteria), the generation of genetic variants is not influenced by any human intervention. Those mutants are constantly produced. In the usual setting, most mutants are less fit than the wild-type strain and therefore are outcompeted. If not, they replace the current strain and become the new wild-type. What happens in the presence of interventions is that the fitness landscape changes. For instance, if we give a patient drugs, a mutant resistant to drugs with a fitness less than the wild-type in the absence of drug treatment has a significant advantage and can outcompete the wild-type strain.</p>
</div>
<div id="co-evolution" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.9</span> Co-evolution</h2>
<p>While the hosts infected by ID also evolve, this usually happens on much slower time-scales. As such, studying evolution by assuming only the ID evolves and not the host is often a good approximation. However, there are examples where host evolution needs to be considered. A good example is the introduction of myxoma virus to control Australian rabbit populations. Evolution of both the virus and rabbits was observed. Over longer time-scales, features such as sickle cell anemia, which comes from a mutation that is associated with reduced malaria morbidity, is likely a trait some humans evolved in response to malaria. A discussion of genetic characteristics in humans that might be attributable to evolution in response to specific infectious diseases is provided in <span class="citation">(Pittman et al. <a href="#ref-pittman16">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="modeling-evolutionary-dynamics" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.10</span> Modeling Evolutionary Dynamics</h2>
<p>To study evolutionary dynamics, we will need to implement models that allow for changes in the system on top of the non-evolutionary dynamics of the ID. Unless we plan to model many different potential new variants, it is often easiest to pre-specify the number of variants we want to track. In the simplest form where we only track pathogen evolution, we might model the wild-type (normal, pre-existing) form of the pathogen and a single mutant that is different in some important characteristic, e.g., resistant to a drug or able to evade a vaccine. We would build a model with these compartments. We often also pre-specify the characteristics (i.e., the parameter values) for both the wild-type and mutant. We implement the process of mutant generation in the model and run the simulation. Under certain circumstances, we might see the mutant be generated and take over the population.</p>
<p>If we want to model many different mutants, maybe allowing for random, not pre-specified, differences in their fitness, and perhaps even allowing for host evolution, the models get quite a bit more complicated. They are not necessarily conceptually harder, but there is more bookkeeping and coding involved making it technically trickier.</p>
