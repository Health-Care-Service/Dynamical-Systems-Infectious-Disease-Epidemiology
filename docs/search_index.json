As such, it is well studied, often taught, and good resources exist. So why another book on that topic? While there are plenty of infectious disease epidemiology books that cover the topic from a classical epidemiological perspective, such an approach often ignores or minimizes the importance of interactions. On the other side, the well-developed field of infectious disease modeling has its main focus on studying the interactions and resulting dynamics of ID. Good textbooks exist, such as (Matt J Keeling and Rohani 2008, Vynnycky and White (2010)), but require a strong quantitate and mathematical background from the student. This book is intended to fill the gap. Infectious disease topics are discussed from a dynamical systems perspective, but without a strong emphasis on teaching modeling - though we believe any modern infectious disease epidemiologist needs to have some familiarity with models, and as such, this book contains models and equations - but does not try to teach the student to become a modeler, instead the focus is on understanding the modeling perspective and becoming an educated consumer of models. 1.2 What this book does and does not cover This book does not teach basic concepts of epidemiology. We assume readers are familiar with basic ideas such as incidence and prevalence, basic study design such as cohort and case-control studies and clinical trials, and other basic epidemiological concepts. For readers unfamiliar with these ideas, we suggest [@]. This book does also not teach much about specific infectious diseases. While many different infectious diseases appear in this book, the goal is not to describe any one in much detail. Instead, they appear as examples of general dynamical patterns and concepts the book covers. For information on the epidemiology of specific infectious diseases, good resources are e.g. [@]. Finally, while this book takes a modeling perspective, it does not intend to teach modeling. For anyone interested in learning how to build and analyze their own infectious disease models - a skill we highly recommend learning - we suggest e.g. (Matt J Keeling and Rohani 2008,Vynnycky and White (2010)). Maybe the material closest in approach to this book is not another book but the online course “Dynamics of Infectious Diseases” developed and taught by multiple faculty at Penn State University and hosted on Coursera (???). This course is free to take and I can strongly recommend it. 1.3 Computer exercises Modern infectious disease epidemiology is inherently computational. As such, models feature prominently in this book. As a complement to this book, I wrote a user-friendly R package, DSAIDE, which allows the reader to explore and further learn all the topics discussed in this book through hands-on computer exercises. These computer exercises and the use of the DSAIDE package do not require coding skills. For a more detailed description of the DSAIDE package, see (???). At the end of each chapter, I mention which simulation/app from the DSAIDE package corresponds to the material covered in the chapter. 1.4 References References "],

In public health, there is the basic idea - most often applied to infectious diseases - of the agent - host - environment system. A system perspective - The epidemiological triangle Similarly, one can think of the basic epidemiological concept of person - place - time as describing a system. The notion of a system is present in virtually every field of research, ranging from the hard sciences to social sciences and business. The scientific approach that has generally been the most successful in the past was to break down a system into its individual components and study the components one at a time. This is usually referred to as the reductionistic approach. This approach to understanding the world is still very powerful and useful. A complementary approach, which has seen increased use, is to look at “the whole” system at once, instead of each component at a time. This approach can provide insights that might not be obtained by the purely reductionist approach. This approach of looking at the whole system at once is often referred to as systems thinking/approach. 2.3 Systems Thinking The term systems thinking or systems approach or similar such terminology has become popular in various fields during the last few decades. It is not a very clearly defined term, but in general a systems perspective looks at multiple - often many - components that interact with each other in potentially complicated ways. For instance the problem of obesity has many different components that interact in potentially complicated ways to affect a person’s weight. Complex systems are basically everywhere. The approach of studying (most of) the system at once instead of looking at a single component at a time is the hallmark of the systems approach Obesity as a complex system: http://goo.gl/m2Qq13 2.4 Sytems Thinking and Models Models are everywhere in science. Models can be conceptual (e.g. graphs or charts), experimental model systems (e.g. a specific mouse strain in immunology) or take the form of mathematical/computer models. Once we take the systems perspective, we have to deal with many components that interact in potentially complicated ways. This makes study and analysis complicated, especially if we are trying to gain insights into the causal and mechanistic connections between some quantity (exposure) and some outcome. When taking a systems approach, it is therefore often not enough to have a conceptual model. While a conceptual approach often allows some qualitative understanding, it is somewhat limiting. It is for instance almost impossible to gain a good quantitative understanding how changes in certain conditions and components of a system lead to changes for outcomes of interest by relying on conceptual approaches alone. If we want to go beyond qualitative and move toward a quantitative understanding (i.e. ‘increasing tobacco tax by X% will reduce smoking-related healthcare costs by Y%’), we need mathematical/computational models. There are many different types of models one can implement. The following provides a - very brief - overview of different modeling approaches. 2.4.1 Phenomenological (statistical) Models A huge class of models consists of what we usually refer to as statistical models. In the context of this discussion, I prefer to label them phenomenological models, but that terminology is rarely used. The idea behind the statistical/phenomenological approach is to use a mathematical or computational model to study if there are any patterns between the input (exposure and other variables) and the output (outcomes of interest). For instance a linear regression model investigates if there is a pattern/correlation between input and output that can be well approximated by a linear function. More complicated statistical models exist, some go by the name of machine learning methods. All of these models try to determine if there are patterns between inputs and outputs of interest in the data. One feature these statistical/phenomenological models have in common is that they do not try to describe the mechanisms of interactions within the system that lead to the observed input-output relations. For instance if we find that the relation between number of cigarettes smoked per day and the 5-year risk of lung cancer can be approximated by a linear function, it does not tell us much about the mechanisms leading from smoking to lung cancer. 2.4.2 Mechanistic Models Another class of models are those that try to explicitly - albeit usually in very simplified form - try to model the mechanisms of interaction among system components. Those models are commonly used for infectious disease studies. For instance we might want to know how drug dose affects pathogen clearance inside an infected patient. We could collect data on both (such data often needs to come from animal models) and see if a straight line or other kind of model fits the data. Alternatively, we could try to build a model that explicitly captures the mechanism of the drug killing the pathogen, and then see if this mechanistic model describes the data well. The advantage of these kinds of models is that they potentially provide better and deeper understanding of the system. The main disadvantage is that we already need to know (or at least assume) a good bit about how the components interact for us to be able to build such a model. If we don’t know what mechanisms might lead to some input impacting some output, we can’t build a mechanistic model. Both phenomenological (statistical) and mechanistic models are useful tools with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Which one to use depends on the question and study system. For this course, we will focus on mechanistic models. These kinds of models can be formulated in many different ways. We discuss some below. 2.4.3 Dynamical Systems Thinking/Modeling The dynamical part adds an explicit time component to the system. To see the difference between a dynamical system and a ‘static’ one, consider this example: We could study how a change in tobacco taxes might lead to changes in healthcare costs in a given state. Of course, time is present in this system: First we change the taxes, then we look at changes in costs over some time frame. However, when studying this system, one usually doesn’t need to consider an explicitly time-dependent dynamic. Instead one looks at 2 scenarios: Taxes 1 &amp; Costs 1 versus Taxes 2 &amp; Costs 2. It is usually not necessary to model or simulate the chain of events leading from tax change to cost change while explicitly accounting for time. In contrast, in a dynamical system the model explicitly undergoes changes in time. We might often want to know how certain changes to the system (e.g. interventions) lead to changes in outcomes through a dynamical/time-dependent chain of events. For infectious diseases, we most often have some underlying dynamics that we need to take into account (e.g. an ongoing outbreak) and on top of which we might want to implement some interventions. Therefore, the dynamical perspective is often used. Even if a specific disease can be considered to be ‘steady’ before we implement an intervention (e.g. a given level of TB in a country), there is still disease transmission between individuals happening, which most often makes the dynamical approach more suitable. We can illustrate this dynamical perspective by extending the epidemiological triangle. The following figure shows the components and the interactions of the triangle changing over time. Dynamic Epidemiological Triangle. Interactions between agent, host and environment change explicitly with time - indicated by the different coloring for each component and interaction. 2.4.4 Types of dynamical, mechanistic models When building models based on a systems approach, there are two main approaches. In one approach, the model is made up of individual agents/individuals and is thus called Agent based or Individual based model. The agents/individuals - which often but not always are humans - interact with each other. Each agent has certain properties and undergoes certain actions. The interactions of all agents leads to potentially interesting and complex dynamics. Schelling’s segregation model (see this module’s videos) is a nice example of such an agent based model. Another approach simplifies the system by not tracking every individual agent, but instead only keeps track of total agents/individuals in certain states. For instance for infectious disease models, we might only keep track of the total number of individuals who are susceptible, infectious and recovered/immune. This simplifies models immensely. If we had a population of a 100, 1000 or 10,000, we would need to keep track of as many agents. If we only keep track of total number of individuals in the 3 states just mentioned, we only need to track how our 3 states - usually called compartments - change, namely we need to track changes in the numbers of susceptible/infected/recovered - no matter how large our population. While these compartmental models are obviously simplifications of the real system, they often retain enough of the model complexity to allow us to study the system well. Because of this, the majority of models used in infectious disease epidemiology are these types of compartmental models, and we will use them throughout the course. If you want to read a bit more about these compartmental models, check out this Wikipedia article "],
["characterizing-infection-states.html", "3 Characterizing Infection States 3.1 Overview 3.2 Infection states - clinical 3.3 Infection states - epidemiological 3.4 Infection states and modeling 3.5 How many characteristics should we model?", " 3 Characterizing Infection States 3.1 Overview In this module, we will discuss ways to characterize individuals with regard to their ID status. We will consider why some infection states are important for public health control but less for doctors and the opposite. We will also discuss how different ID states might or might not correspond to the compartments in our computer models. 3.2 Infection states - clinical From a purely medical perspective, focusing on one patient at a time, the most important characteristic of a disease is its severity. We would like to know what kind of symptoms a disease produces and how frequently those occur. This is the morbidity profile of a disease. One can consider mortality the “ultimate symptom”. Because of its importance, it is often considered independently. Knowing severity/morbidity/mortality of an ID are generally most important when caring for individual patients. For interventions, understanding what might help mitigate morbidity/mortality is of prime interest. 3.3 Infection states - epidemiological From the perspective of a public health practicioner, other ID characteristics besides morbidity/mortality are very important. We need to know when someone is infectious (e.g. before/without symptoms, or only when symptomatic), how transmission occurs, if recovered individuals become immune, if immunity is waning, etc. The difficult part is that our data often comes from clinical (symptomatic) cases or deaths. If asymptomatic individuals are infectious, or there is underreporting, we often don’t get the full picture. This happened for example during the early days of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The first reports out of Mexico made it look like case fatality ratio (the term case fatality rate is a bad label as this is not a rate) was fairly high. Later, once it was realized that there were many more infections that didn’t go reported, it became clear that the ratio of deaths to infected was thankfully not much different from seasonal influenza. Of course, the medical and epidemiological perspectives are not an ‘either/or’. Instead, success in combating infectious diseases only comes when all aspects are considered. Still, it is useful to keep in mind that certain infection states are more important when considering how to intervene on the individual patient level versus intervention on a population level. 3.4 Infection states and modeling For the compartmental model we looked at so far, individuals were split according to 3 states: susceptible, infected (and infectious) and recovered (and immune). We can build models that allow for additional states. The figure below shows a model with additional compartments. Example of a model with more compartments In general, we need to decide for a specific ID, scenario and question which details to include in our model and which ones to ignore. This not only depends on the ID we study, but also on the question. For instance if we want to study how some control strategies for SARS might reduce the total number of infected but we don’t care about the impact on total deaths (unlikely, but let’s just pretend), then we would not need a dead compartment in our model. However, if we want to keep track of deaths and how they are impacted by our intervention (likely), we do need to track them - even though dead people are not known to transmit SARS. In contrast, we know that for Ebola, dead infected individuals contributed to transmission, so we would likely need them in the model. 3.5 How many characteristics should we model? Tying it back to the “systems approach”: We can never include all components and interactions of a system, even if we build a complicated model. We need to decide which parts are important and need to be in the model, and which ones we can ignore. A simple and maybe obvious example: We never include the hair color of individuals in any infectious disease models (at least I’ve never seen such a model), since we assume that this characteristic is not important for the ID dynamics. Other characteristics are less obvious. For instance for an HIV model, we likely need gender, while a SARS model might ignore this characteristic. We will see many different types of models as we go through the course. In general, the models will include the feature we are focusing on, while excluding others. For instance we might include human and mosquitos for vector-borne IDs but ignore things like asymptomatic or presymptomatic states. This is mainly done to keep models simple and focus on one feature at a time. Models that address “real” questions often – but not always – include a fair number of details. To build models that are suitable to study a specific system, model builders need to be experts on the system they want to study and/or collaborate with subject matter experts. Building a good model needs to follow the Goldilocks Principle: If a model is too small/simple, it likely doesn’t approximate the real system very well. If the model is too big and complicated, it is difficulty to build, hard to analyze, prone to mistakes, and might not lead to much insight (i.e. the model is a big black box). THe goal is to get the model just right in terms of size and complexity. Unfortunately, there is no recipe or formula specifiny how to build a just right model. Being able to build models that are approrpiate/suitable for a given ID and question distinguishes good modelers/scientists from less good ones. Also, the model building and analysis process is often iterative. After a model has been built and studied, it might become clear – e.g. by comparing the model with data – that important components or interactions have been ignored or not been included properly. This leads to model modification and refinement. This back and forth between model and data/the real world can happen over multiple iterations. "],

Some ID produce sporadic outbreaks and then disappear for years. Ebola is a prominent example. We will discuss in a future module how to figure out what leads to the (local) extinction of an ID. Many other ID show oscillatory behavior, i.e. we get repeated outbreaks every so often, with some time of no or little disease in between. For some ID, the outbreaks are seasonal/annual, for other ID, the cycles are multi-year. Examples of ID cycles. From (Matt J Keeling and Rohani 2008). Why are some ID seasonal, some not? What mechanisms lead to seasonal or multi-year oscillations? What determines the timing between outbreaks? Yet other IDs seem to have “settled down” and occur more or less at a steady level, with only minor fluctuations. TB and HIV in some parts of the world, as well as certain STD and chronic viral infections of for instance the herpes virus family seem to have such a dynamic. The following discusses the factors affecting these different ID dynamics patterns. 4.2 Resource Replenishment So far, we mainly looked at scenarios where some ID caused a single outbreak. As we saw, outbreaks wane because eventually there are not enough susceptible individuals around to sustain ongoing transmission. This is a very general ecological principle: Without replenishment of resources, some consumer of such resources will eventually die out. We see that in predators eating pray, forest fires “eating” trees, and pathogens “eating” their hosts. If the resources are not replenished quickly enough, the consumer of these resources will go extinct. To sustain continued presence of the consumer/predator, resources need to be replenished. For our scenario, the resource consumer is the ID and the resources are the hosts, usually humans. Replenishment of susceptible hosts can happen through different mechanisms. Most common are birth of new, susceptible individuals, and loss of immunity. Migration, if strong, can be another way susceptible hosts can be replenished. Similarly, individuals that become newly sexually active correspond to the birth of new susceptibles for sexually transmitted infections. If the replenishment of new susceptibles is rapid, an ID might be able to maintain itself in a population and never go extinct. (Extinction will be discussed in more detail in a later unit.) 4.3 Intrinisic Cycles The interaction between susceptible and infectious hosts can leads to a dynamical pattern that can/does produce oscillations. Specifically, the dynamics of resource consumption (depletion of susceptible hosts), waning ID incidence due to reduced availability of hosts, and subsequent replenishment of susceptibes can lead to cycles. Since these cycles are not driven by anything “from the outside” and arise purely due to the complex interplay between host resources and ID, there are sometimes called intrinsic cycles/oscillations. The timing of these cycles (the period of the oscillations) is determined by characteristics of the ID and scenario. For instance the duration of the infectious period and the transmissibility of the host generally influence the timing between outbreaks. In ecology, such cycles are well studied and go by the terminology of predator-prey systems. 4.4 Intrinisic Cycles and models One can sometimes compute the time between outbreaks. For the simple compartmental SIR model, an approximate equation for the period close to the endemic state is \\[T \\approx 2 \\pi \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{LD}{R_0 - 1} \\right)}\\] Here, L is the average lifespan of a host, D is the average duration of infectiousness, and R0 is the basic reproductive number - a quantity we will discuss shortly. For more details on this equations, see e.g. (Matt J Keeling and Rohani 2008). For more complicated models and real-world scenarios where the simple SIR model is not a good approximation, the equation just provided does not apply anymore. It might not even be possible to write down any equation. But the main point still holds in such a case, namely there is a relation between intrinsic characteristics of the system, such as duration of infectious period (D) and transmissibility of the disease (R0), and the period of the oscillations. In cases where we cannot derive a mathematical equation, we can get the answer computationally. We can vary a parameter of interest, for instance the duration of the infectious period, and use the model to simulate the ID and record the period of the cycles, T. Finally, by plotting a figure showing D on the x-axis and T on the y-axis, we obtain a relation between these quantities. 4.5 External drivers of seasonality Another mechanism that can lead to osciallations in the dynamics of ID can come from “external” drivers. Of course, these processes are still part of the whole system, but not as directly as the dynamics and interaction of the hosts. In that sense we consider it an external process. Weather is one of the most important external factors. Many ID are influenced by the weather. For instance influenza virus survives better when vapor pressure is low, which is usually the case in temperate regions in winter (M. Lipsitch and Viboud 2009, Shaman et al. (2010)). Other types of seasonality are related to human activity and behavior. For instance many childhood diseases increase in incidence when a new school year starts. For some ID, weather and behavior interact. Many water-borne diseases in the U.S. see an uptick in summer. This is due to behavior changes in the host: More people swim in outdoor water in the summer. Often, more than one mechanism occurs and influences the ID dynamics. As such, it is often not possible to isolate a single factor as the main important one. It often depends on the specific setting. 4.6 Notes on Cycles In the type of models we have looked at so far, sustained oscillations need something like seasonality. Without it, the cycles die out and the disease reaches a steady, endemic state. For more complex models or models that include stochastic dynamics (something we’ll discuss in a later module), cycles can be maintained even in the absence of external drivers. 4.7 Steady states In addition to single outbreaks or recurrent cycles, ID often also reach a state where the incidence/prevalence in a population is roughly constant. This is usually referred to as endemic state. Examples of that are e.g. helminth infections in many African countries (in the absence of control efforts) or certain sexually transmitted diseases in developed countries. The following figure shows for instance that Gonorrhea incidence was fairly stable between 1950-1965 and again 1995-2005. Gonorrhea cases in the US. Source CDC. Note that while at steady state, the total number of ID cases does not change, there is usually still constant turnover. Some individuals get infected, while others recover or die. It just happens that these processes balance each other, making the total numbers roughly constant. 4.8 Steady states and models (M) When an ID reaches a steady state, a model based on ordinary differential equations, such as the basic SIR model, simplifies by a lot. Specifically, at steady state, there are – by definition – no changes in the total number of individuals in each compartment. Therefore the left side of the equations is zero, leading to the following set of equations: \\[\\dot S = 0 = \\lambda -\\beta SI - nS\\] \\[\\dot I = 0 = \\beta S I - \\gamma I - nI\\] \\[\\dot R = 0 = \\gamma I - nR\\] We again used \\(\\lambda\\) for the birth rate and \\(n\\) for the death rate. The system of differential equations has turned into a system of algebraic equations. For a fairly small set of equations (usually &lt;=5), one can obtain equations for the compartments (S, I, and R in this case) at steady state that are only function of the model parameters. While it is in general possible to solve models with more compartments/equations, the resulting expressions are usually so big and unwieldy to not provide much useful insight. The hard method of solving this set of equations is with pen and paper. Nowadays, there is software that can do it for you. R is not suitable for solving symbolic equations. The two main packages for such tasks are Maple and Mathematica. Both are commercial products, fairly powerful and quite expensive. If you only need a program for occasionally solving such equations, free alternatives are available. I usually use Maxima. Other packages exist. Solving these equations in Maxima would look as follows: Maxima code for solving the SIR model steady state equations. We thus find the values for the number of susceptible, infected and recovered at steady state as a function of the model parameters: \\[S_{s} = \\frac{\\gamma + n}{\\beta}\\] \\[I_{s} = \\frac{\\beta \\lambda - n (n+ \\gamma)}{\\beta (n+ \\gamma)}\\] \\[R_{s} = \\frac{\\beta \\lambda \\gamma - \\gamma n(n+ \\gamma)}{\\beta n (n+ \\gamma) }\\] This allows us to rapidly gain insight into the system behavior. For instance we can see that for an endemic steady state to be possible (i.e. for Is &gt; 0), we need \\(\\beta \\lambda &gt; n(n+ \\gamma)\\). We can make intuitive sense out of this expression: The combination of pathogen transmission capacity (\\(\\beta\\)) and birth rate (\\(\\lambda\\)), which support ID persistence, needs to be stronger than the effects of general host death \\(n\\) and host recovery \\(\\gamma\\). We will later see that this relates to the concept of reproductive number. Often, the model is too complicated to obtain useful equations for the steady state values of the model variables. Fortunately, we can always determine them numerically. We simply start the simulation with some values and run it long enough until it has settled down (we need to make sure it actually does have a steady state). We can then record the steady state values, change some parameter and repeat. At the end, we can plot a figure showing how the steady state values change with some model parameter. This approach is obviously much slower than just looking at the mathematical equations. However, often - especially for big models - it’s the only feasible approach. 4.9 ID Dynamics in changing populations The idea of resource replenishment described above assumes in its simplest forms that in the absence of the ID, the host population is in steady state. That is, the number of births and deaths balance each other and the population size therefore stays constant. We then investigate ID dynamics on top of such a constant population (which then might not be constant anymore if the disease leads to many deaths). One can go a step further and consider an underlying population that changes in size due to underlying growth or decline of the population. We can then study the dynamics of an ID on top of an already dynamically changing population. While this is generally not much more complicated to do with computer models, it is harder to understand what exactly is going on in the system. For instance consider an ID with high mortality in a growing population. If we just looked at the population size, it could be that it remains constant, due to the 2 processes of natural population growth and disease induced mortality balancing each other. We therefore need to carefully study how the different processes affect ID dynamics. 4.10 References References "],

It is simple in its definition and rather useful. The hard part is to properly estimate the reproductive number for a given disease and scenario. We will discuss all these aspects in the following. 5.2 Background We generally want to prevent infectious diseases from causing outbreaks, stop already ongoing outbreaks, reduce the number of people getting infected, or even bolder, try to eradicate a disease. If we were able to make a vaccine against an infectious disease, it is useful to know what fraction of the population should be vaccinated to prevent future outbreaks or even eradicate the disease. Assume you asked the “person on the street” the question: “If we wanted to prevent a potential future SARS outbreak, what fraction of the U.S. population do we need to vaccinate to make a large-scale outbreak impossible?” I suspect that most people would likely say that pretty much everyone needs to be vaccinated to prevent outbreaks. A smaller number of people might realize that we don’t need to vaccinate everyone, just enough people to sufficiently reduce the disease’s transmission potential. To reach the second answer, one needs to have thought about how infectious diseases ‘work’. If you happen to come across an ID public health specialist or ID modeler, you might get yet a different answer, namely they might provide you with a quantiative estimate of the fraction of people that might need to get vaccinated. They might for instance tell you that we would need to vaccinate around 70% of the population. This is of course the best kind of information. How do we figure this out? That’s where the reproductive number concept comes into play. 5.3 Reproductive number definition The concept and definition of the reproductive number are rather straightforward: The reproductive number (usually abbreviated with R), is defined as the average total number of secondary infectious cases caused by one infectious individual (before they recover or die or are otherwise not able to further transmit). The following figure illustrates the concept. Schematic showing the definition of the reproductive number. Each person `produces’ on average 2 other infectious individuals. (Of course, we would usually need to have more data than shown in this figure to properly estimate R.) 5.4 Reproductive number details Let’s look a bit closer at the definion for R. First, note that it applies to population averages. Every single person might infect none, a few or many others. R does not capture this detail, it only describes the average. That’s why it is for instance possible to have R=2.5 or other non-integer numbers. Of course it’s not possible for an individual to infect 2.5 others, but since R describes an average, such fractional infections are possible. This population average feature of R is a strength, since it makes R fairly easy to determine. It is also a weakness, since often we’d like to know dispersion in addition to the mean/average - we’ll discuss that when we deal with ideas such as population heterogeneity, core groups and superspreaders later on. Another point to note is that the definition is about the number of new infectious hosts produced by one infectious host. For some diseases, being infected and being infectious are pretty much the same. E.g. pretty much everyone who is infected with HIV is also - to some degree - infectious. For other diseases, that’s not the case. For instance the majority of people who get infected with TB will never reach a state where they are infectious. So to compute R, we don’t count the average number of individuals an infectious person infects, but only those that later go on to become infectious themselves. The same idea applies when we talk about diseases that have multiple hosts. R is defined as the number of infectious hosts ‘produced’ by one infectious host of the same type. For instance for vector-borne diseases, R would be the number of infectious humans ‘produced’ by one infectious humans via the intermediary mosquito/vector stage. While conceptually still straightforward, measuring and computing R/R0 in such multi-host situations can get tricky. Note: Here and in other places, I’m often sloppy and use the word “infected” even if more precisely, I mean “infectious”. You will find such somewhat sloppy terminology throughout the literature. It is usually clear from the context if one means an ‘infected and infectious’ person or just someone who is infected but not infectious (the latter are sometimes called exposed). So when you read ‘infected’ here and other places, assume it means that host is ‘infectious’ as well, unless otherwise stated. 5.5 Basic reproductive number A special case of the reproductive number is at the beginning of an outbreak, when essentially everyone in the population is susceptible. In this case, when we assume everyone is susceptible, we define a special quantitiy called the basic reproductive number, abbreviated as R0. The quantity R0 is a measurement of the transmission potential of a disease in a specific setting. It does by definition not change during an ongoing outbreak. The more general definition of the reproductive number, R, does change during an outbreak. We’ll discuss that more below. 5.6 Notes on the reproductive number While I will be mainly using the term reproductive number, there are alternative names for R. In general any combination of reproductive/reproduction and ratio/number is ok terminology. In its early days, R was called reproductive rate. This is incorrect terminology and should not be used. R is not a rate (there are no units of 1/time). Why does that matter? See the ‘R is not a rate’ box for an example. While we often say “Infectious disease X has an R0 of Y”, this is only an approximationfully correct. R/R0 also depends on the setting. The potential for transmission for many ID is much higher in for instance crowded locations (prisons, slums, cruise ships), or among “high risk groups” (e.g. STD in sex workers). For instance R0 &lt; 1 for HIV in the general population but it is not going away because it has an R0 &gt; 1 in certain subgroups. When we talk about R, it is therefore useful to specify the scenario/population/setting we are talking about. In this reading, and more generally in the literature, you find the use of R0, R or effective R (Reff) often used (sloppily) in an interchangeable manner. Usually it’s clear from the context if the symbol refers specifically to R0 at the beginning of an outbreak in a susceptible population, or more generally to R, the average number of secondary infectious cases produced by one infectious individual in any population. 5.6.1 Why R is not a rate - Example It is important to understand that R only provides a measure of how transmissible a pathogen is, R does not provide any information about the speed at which transmission occurs. This is an important limiation of R. Consider 2 infections with the similar reproductive number, say HIV and SARS, which are both estimated to have a reproductive number of around 3-4. If we let an outbreak ‘run its course’, we would - based on R - expect to get the same number of infected individuals. However, the dynamics at which those infections occur will be quite different. SARS spreads rapidly, i.e. an infected person infects 3-4 others within a few weeks. On the other hand, a person infected with HIV will infect others on a timeframe of years. These different dynamics have of course important implications on the control approaches against diseases. Thus, while knowing R is important for a given disease, it doesn’t tell ‘the full story’. 5.7 Outbreaks and the change in R As stated above, at the beginning of an outbreak, a specific disease in a certain setting will have some value R0. As the outbreak progresses, more and more hosts become infected and - for many diseases - either die or recover and become immune to further infection. This leads to a reduction in the reproductive number as the outbreak progresses. For instance if initially, with everyone susceptible, R0=3, then once a third of the population have become infected and immune, an infectious person who would have infected 3 others at the beginning of an outbreak now ‘wastes’ one of their transmissions on an already immune person, and therefore only infects 2 others. Similarly, once 2/3 of the population have become infected and immune, R will have dropped to 1. At this point the outbreak does not grow further (recall, we need R&gt;1 for growth). Instead, the outbreak has reached its peak and now starts to decline, with R continuing to go down as less and less susceptibles remain. 5.8 Reproductive number and outbreak control So how is the reproductive number related to infectious disease outbreaks? It is intuitively clear that if on average every infectious person “produces” more than 1 subsequent infectious person, we get a growing outbreak. In contrast, if every infectious person “produces” less than 1 subsequent infectious person, the pathogen might transmit a few times but pretty soon it will disappear. Thus if we can achieve R0 &lt; 1, e.g. through vaccination, we can prevent an outbreak from starting. Further, if during an outbreak we can intervene to get R &lt; 1, the outbreak is going to fizzle out. If we wanted to stop any further transmission, we would need to get R even lower, namely R = 0. Intervention efforts try to achieve an R as low as possible. Impact of an Intervention on transmission. 5.8.1 R and outbreak control - Example During the large Ebola outbreak in West Africa which started in 2013, a few Ebola patients came to the U.S. and the goal was to have R = 0, i.e. no ongoing transmission. That didn’t quite happen, a few new individuals got infected, but R was very close to zero. In contras, in West Africa there was little hope to get R = 0 quickly. Fortunately, R &lt; 1 is enough. So we can ‘tolerate’ a few further transmissions and new cases and still get the outbreak eventually under control. Of course, in general we want to get R as close to 0 as possible, especially for disease as deadly as Ebola. But to get an outbreak to fizzle out, we only need R &lt; 1, not R = 0. 5.9 Reproductive number and ID eradication If we could achieve R0 &lt; 1 globally everywhere, we could eventually eradicate a disease. The ability to do that depends on many factors. One important one is the R0 value of any ID before we start an eradication campaign. Intuitively, the higher R0, the harder it will be to get it to &lt; 1. We’ll make that more specific below. 5.10 Connecting intervention efforts and R We just discussed that R &lt; 1 means no outbreak occurs. Let’s make the relation between intervention efforts and the reproductive number a bit more quantitative. As a simple example, consider an infectious disease with R0=2. That means on average, every infected person infects 2 others. If we could somehow protect a bit more than half of the susceptibles, then a person who might have become infected can’t become infected anymore, and the effective R (sometimes called Reff) drops below 1. More generally, to prevent an outbreak, a fraction p = 1-1/R0 of the population needs to be protected (e.g. through vaccination). So for R0 = 2, 50% protection is needed. The level of population protection at which R=1 is called critical herd/population immunity level. The relation between original/basic reproductive number, vaccine/intervention coverage and effective R is R= R0(1-p). That’s true if we assume that the intervention fully protects those to whom it is applied. If instead the intervention is not perfect, we have R=R0(1-ep), where e is the effectiveness of the intervention/vaccine (e=1 is a perfectly effective intervention). From this, it follows that the higher R0, the harder it is to control and ID. R0 and Interventions. From (Matt J Keeling and Rohani 2008). 5.11 R and the SIR model We can connect the concept that R&gt;1 leads to growth and R&lt;1 leads to decline in infectious persons with the simple SIR model for an outbreak. The model describes the dynamics (growth or decline) of susceptible individuals, S, infected/infectious individuals, I, and recovered individuals, R. (Don’t confuse this R with the R/R0 from the reproductive number. Unfortunately it is customary to use the same letter for both.) \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\dot S &amp;= -\\beta SI \\\\ \\dot I &amp;= \\beta S I - \\gamma I \\\\ \\dot R &amp;= \\gamma I \\end{aligned} \\] For this model, what needs to be true to get an increase in the number of infectious hosts? The influx of new infectious hosts, \\(\\beta S I\\) needs to be larger than the outflow \\(\\gamma I\\). This condition, \\(\\beta S I &gt; \\gamma I\\), can be rewritten as \\(1 &lt; \\frac{ \\beta S }{ \\gamma}\\). We then define the quantity on the right side of this condition as the reproductive number, \\(R = \\frac{ \\beta S }{ \\gamma}\\). At the beginning of an outbreak, where everyone is assumed to be susceptible (written as S= S0), we have the special case of the basic reproductive number, \\(R_0 = \\frac{ \\beta S_0 }{ \\gamma}\\). Note that the rate of recovery \\(\\gamma\\) is related to the average duration of infection, D as \\(D=1 / \\gamma\\). Therefore, one can also write \\(R = D \\beta S\\), with the special case R0 for S=S0, i.e. at the beginning of an outbreak. 5.12 How to determine R - Overview Knowing the reproductive number for a specific pathogen and scenario is important to allow for adequate intervention planning. There are multiple ways to estimate R from data, we’ll briefly discuss them now. 5.13 Determine R at the beginning of an outbreak Very early in an outbreak, there will only be a few cases and they occur seemingly randomly/stochastically. If the outbreak keeps growing, after a while the case numbers increase exponentially. The exponential growth rate, r, can be estimated from the data, essentially by fitting a straight line to the case report data. To go from the growth rate to R, we need some further information, namely we need to know the serial interval. The serial interval, T, is the time between onset of infection in one host to onset of infection in a secondary host. Sometimes T can be approximated by the duration of the infectious period, D. Once we know r and T, we can compute R. There are different equations relating r and T to R, they depend on specific assumptions one makes about the disease. One relation between r, T and R is given by R = 1 + rT, another one is given by R = e^rT. For assumptions underlying these equations and further details, see e.g. (Wallinga and Lipsitch 2007). Example of R0 estimation based on case data in the early stages of an outbreak. Source: Viboud et al 2006 Vaccine (Viboud et al. 2006). 5.14 Determine R once the outbreak is over A larger R leads to a larger outbreak (ignoring things like interventions, behavior change, etc.). A main reason to determine R is so we can use it to predict the expected size of an (uncontrolled) outbreak - and more importantly, we can learn how strong our intervention efforts need to be. But we can also flip things around. Once an (uncontrolled) outbreak has occured, knowing the outbreak size can allow us to estimate R. It is often possible to estimate outbreak sizes after an outbreak has occured, e.g. through serosurveys which show antibodies against the disease and therefore indicate who got infected. We don’t need any ‘timing’ information, just the fraction infected at the end. Essentially, we therefore need to know the number of people that got infected, and the number of people who were at risk (i.e. the susceptibles) at the begining of the outbreak. Once we know that, we can estimate R. More specifically, assume we know the final size of the outbreak, i.e. total fraction of those becoming infected, If = Itot/N, where N is the population at risk and Itot is the total number of infected. We then also know the fraction of susceptibles that are left at the end of an outbreak, Sf=1-If. To find R/R0, we can use the equation R=ln(Sf)/(Sf - 1)$ (here, ln is the natural logarithm). The figure below shows the relation between the fraction infected and R0 graphically. The relation between R0 and outbreak Size. If we have information about the size of an outbreak (in the absence of control measures), we can use it to estimate R0. Source: Keeling and Rohani 2008 (Matt J Keeling and Rohani 2008). 5.15 Determining R at the Endemic/steady state For an ID that is at an endemic/steady state, we have another way of determining R0. At the endemic equilibrium the reproductive number is Req = 1. If it weren’t, the ID would either grow or decline and it wouldn’t be the endemic state. At this endemic state, a fraction of the population is still susceptible, Seq. By definition, at the beginning of an ID with transmissibility R0, everyone is susceptible (S0=1, expressed as fraction). If we know Seq, we can then compute R0 as given by R0 = Req S0/Seq = 1/ Seq. As an example, if at an endemic state (with Req=1), 50% of the population is susceptible, then at the beginning, when 100% of the population was susceptible, we have R0=2. Conversely, if we know R0, we can predict the number of susceptibles at the endemic state, Seq=1/R0. 5.16 Determining R through Age of Infection For those ID for which an infection induces long-lasting immunity, i.e. where a host can only be infected once, the age of infection is an important concept. Intuitively, the more infectious a disease is, the more likely it is that a host gets an ID at an early age. For an ID that induces immunity, one can collect serological data (i.e. antibody measurements) to determine the fraction of individuals of a given age who have antibodies, which means they have been previously infected (assuming for the moment that no vaccine is available). One can define the median age of infection as the age at which 50% of the population has been infected. Fraction seropositive (previously infected) as function of age for measles. Source (Matt J Keeling and Rohani 2008). For a simple model with certain assumptions, one can find an approximating equation connecting the median age of infection and the basic reproductive number with the equation \\(A \\approx \\frac {L}{R_0 - 1}\\) or rewritten \\(R_0 \\approx \\frac{L}{A} + 1\\). In this equation, L is the average life expectancy of a host and A is the median age of infection. This again shows what we expect intuitively: Higher R0, i.e. more infectious ID, leads to an earlier age of infection. Note: If you want to determine R/R0 to be used as parameter in a mathematical transmission model, you use this approach based on the age-seroprevalence relation even if the model you plan on using doesn’t have age in it. 5.17 Determining R through fitting a full transmission model Instead of just using data for the initial exponential growth phase, determining r and computing R0 as specified above, we can fit some or all outbreak data to an SIR type model. We use the data to estimate the parameters of the model. For instance for the simple SIR model, we would estimate the transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) and recovery rate \\(\\gamma\\). We can then use the equation for R0 for a given model to compute its value. For the simple SIR model, that would be \\(R_0 = \\frac{\\beta S_0}{\\gamma}\\). 5.18 Computing R for a given model Once a mathematical model for a given ID and setting has been specified, it is often useful to compute R0 for the model. Above, we looked at one way to get R0 for the basic SIR model, i.e. we determined that \\(\\beta S / \\gamma\\) needs to be greater than 1 and that turned out to be R0. However, it is often better to derive R0 for a given model by starting with the basic definition: R0 is the average number of secondary infections caused by one infected individual,assuming the population is fully susceptible. We can then reason as follows: An individual infected person infects new susceptibles at a rate \\(\\beta S_0)\\), for a duration of \\(1/ \\gamma\\). Therefore the total number of new infected individuals is \\(\\beta S_0 / \\gamma\\). Let’s apply the same reasoning to a few variations of the SIR model. Consider the following SIR model with an additional, disease-induced mortality at rate m. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\dot S &amp;= -\\beta SI \\\\ \\dot I &amp;= \\beta S I - \\gamma I - m I\\\\ \\dot R &amp;= \\gamma I \\end{aligned} \\] An individual infected again infects at rate \\(\\beta S\\). The average duration for which an individual is infectious is now \\(1 / (\\gamma + m)\\), i.e. the sum of all the outflows out of the I compartment. That’s a general rule: The average duration of stay in a given compartment is the inverse of the sum of all the outflows. Therefore, for this model we now get \\(R_0 = \\beta S_0 / (\\gamma + m)\\). Here is another model, with an additional compartment of exposed, not-yet infectious hosts (we called those P in previous models). Try to derive R0 using the same line of reasoning as above. Note that you always go “full circle”, i.e. from one infectious individual back to infectious individuals. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\dot S &amp;= -\\beta SI \\\\ \\dot E &amp;= \\beta S I - \\alpha E \\\\ \\dot I &amp;= \\alpha E - \\gamma I - m I\\\\ \\dot R &amp;= \\gamma I \\end{aligned} \\] Here is yet another version, a model we have seen before. This one includes births and deaths. Again, try to determine R0 for it using the basic definition above. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\dot S &amp;=\\lambda -\\beta SI - \\mu S \\\\ \\dot E &amp;= \\beta S I - \\alpha E - \\mu E \\\\ \\dot I &amp;= \\alpha E - \\gamma I - m I - \\mu I \\\\ \\dot R &amp;= \\gamma I - \\mu R \\end{aligned} \\] Computing R for larger models can get complicated. There are specific methods one can use for more complex models. See for instance (Diekmann, Heesterbeek, and Roberts 2010) for further information on this. 5.19 R and model parameterization Knowing R is not only important for public health intervention planning, it is often also an important component of building and analysis of infectious disease models. Most models have a paremeter for the transmission rate, such as \\(\\beta\\) in the models above. To allow simulation of a model, all parameters need to get assigned specific values - chosen to correspond to the disease and scenario under study. Direct estimates of the value for the transmission rate for a model are usually hard to come by. Instead, we usually determine R/R0 for a given ID/setting and then use it to compute \\(\\beta\\) using equations like those shown above. 5.20 Summary The reproductive number is a crucial concept in infectious disease epidemiology. It has a fairly straightforward definition. However, estimating R for a specific disease and scenario is not always easy. Under the assumption that everyone is susceptible, the reproductive number gets the special name basic reproductive number and is a denoted by R0. Knowing R/R~0 helps in planning the strength of interventions. R only measures one – important – component of a disease, namely its transmission potential/transmissibility. For a full understanding of a given disease, we need to know other characteristics such as speed of transmission, severity of disease including mortality, routes of transmission, and many other important details. The simplicity of R is both its strength and its weakness. It gives a quick, quantitative assessment of the transmission potential (and therefore outbreak size and needed control measures) of a disease. However, R is a population level average and ignores heterogeneities of host, agent and environment. Therefore any R estimates are only approximate. 5.21 References References "],

A prime class of pathogens that follow this route are sexually transmitted infections (STI). For STI, the pathogen goes directly from one host to the other. Other pathogens are essentially direct with only a very short time spent outside the host. Ebola is such an example, which requires close contact between infected and uninfected. While there is a short stage outside the host (e.g. pathogen particles suspended in the air, or on a person’s hand), transmission can only occur if the pathogen enters the new host quickly after having been released from the infected host. As such, we usually consider this direct transmission. For direct transmission, there are important ways in which transmission can scale with population size or population density. One often distinguishes between density-dependent and frequency-dependent transmission. Unfortunately, the terminology is not very consistent, other terms are used and sometimes misused. See e.g. (McCallum, Barlow, and Hone 2001, Begon et al. (2002)) for a discussion of this. The main differences between these 2 types of transmission have to do with the scaling of transmission intensity (often measured by the force of infection) as population size changes. This is a feature of the number of contacts that a susceptible has with an infected person. For some types of ID, e.g. STI, the number of contact (i.e. sexual encounters) is likely not too dependent on the population density or size. For instance the average person living in a town of 100,000 people likely has pretty much the same number of sexual contacts compared to the person living in a town if 1 million. One could argue that more opportunities might lead to more sexual contacts, but it’s unlikely to change by much. This type of invariance of transmission is labeled (using the terminology of (McCallum, Barlow, and Hone 2001,Begon et al. (2002))) frequency-dependent. In contrast, for some ID, more individuals (given a constant area) leads to more contacts and more transmission. This might apply to ID such as influenza or norovirus. A scenario where an increase in population size/density leads to a (linear) increase in transmission is usually referred to as density-dependent transmission. However, even for ID that do show some signs of density dependence, the number of social contacts often dominates. For instance a person in a city that is 10 times the size of a smaller city likely won’t have 10 times as many contacts. 6.2.1 Modeling types of direct transmission Assuming the simple SIR model, we have the set of equations \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\dot S &amp;= - \\lambda S \\\\ \\dot I &amp;= \\lambda S - \\gamma I \\\\ \\dot R &amp;= \\gamma I \\end{aligned} \\] where we introduced the force of infection, \\(\\lambda\\) - which we previously set equal to bI. The force of infection can be rewritten in a differnt form, namely \\(\\lambda= cpv\\), where c rate of contacts between hosts, p is the probability that a contact is with an infected host and v is the probability that transmission occurs during contact. As an example, for HIV, c would measure frequency of sexual encounters, p would quantify the fraction of those encounters that happen with an HIV+ individual, and p quantifies the probability that having sex with an HIV+ individual leads to infection. Now, depending on the specific assumptions we make for the different parameters, we can end up with different types of transmission. We generally assume that the probability that a contact is with an infected host is equal to the prevalence of the ID in the population, i.e. p = I/N. This is the so-called well-mixed population assumption and holds for both frequency- and density-dependent SIR type models. If we wanted to relax this assumption, we would need to switch to for instance network-based models or build more complicated compartmental models. For density-dependent transmission, we assume that the rate of contacts is proportional to density of hosts, i.e. c = kN/A, where N is the population size and A the area, and k is some constant of proportionality. As stated above, this might be a good approximation for some ID and scenarios, e.g. influenza. For frequency-dependent transmission, we assume that the rate of contacts is fixed and independent of the density of hosts, i.e. c = f. This might be a good approximation for e.g. sexually transmitted diseases, where the number/density of individuals in the vicinity of an individual does not (or only in a small way) influence the rate at which a person has sexual contacts. We therefore end up with \\(\\lambda_d= kv I/A\\) and \\(\\lambda_f= fv I/N\\) for density- and frequency- dependent transmission. The terms kv and fv are often combined into a new parameter, bd and bf. If population size and area are fixed, the transmission types lead to the same results, as long as parameter values are chosen accordingly. If population size changes (not uncommon) or area changes (less common), one needs to be more careful with the choice of transmission term. 6.2.2 Note on notation Again, specific letters are often used in models in multiple ways. It is common to abbreviate the force of infection with \\(\\lambda\\). This letter is also often used for the birth rate (though here we usually use b). Just be careful when you read papers/models and make sure you know how each letter is defined. 6.3 Summary 6.4 Exercises The Direct transmission app in the DSAIDE package provides hands-on computer exercises for this chapter. 6.5 Further Resources 6.6 References References "],
["environmental-transmission.html", "7 Environmental Transmission 7.1 Overview 7.2 Types of indirect transmission 7.3 Summary 7.4 Exercises 7.5 References", " 7 Environmental Transmission 7.1 Overview A number of pathogens transmit through an environmental stage. This chapter discusses the implications on the ID dynamics in such cases. 7.2 Types of indirect transmission While the distinction between direct and indirect transmission is not clear-cut, we usually consider an ID to have an indirect mode of transmission if the time spent outside the main host is important for the whole transmission cycle. The two main types of stages where a pathogen resides outside the main host are the abiotic environment or another host species. In the case of the former, we consider it to be environmental transmission, in the case of the latter, it is vector-borne. Of course, some ID are even more complicated and have both vector and environmental stages. 7.2.1 Environmental transmission Some diseases are shed by hosts into the environment, where they can survive for a potentially extended time before re-infecting a new host. Cholera is a good example of an ID that has water sources as environmental stage. Similarly, avian influenza is thought to survive in cold lake water for an extended time. The important consequence of environmental transmission is that it potentially allows new infections to occur over long distances in time and space. For instance an infected person might shed Cholera into the water somewhere upstream, and a susceptible person ingests the Cholera bacteria somewhere downstream miles and days or weeks away. This is fundamentally different to direct transmission, which requires close contact. Schematic of an ID with environmental transmission 7.2.2 Modeling environmental transmission Most often, during the environmental stage, we assume that the pathogen does not ‘do’ anything. This is in contrast to vector-borne transmission where the pathogen might for instance undergo replication in the vector. Thus, we assume that infected hosts shed pathogen into the environment, where it decays. If a a susceptible person comes into contact with the pathogen in the environment, an infection can occur. The simplest SIR type model that can capture this process is given by \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\dot S &amp;= - b E S \\\\ \\dot I &amp;= b E S - \\gamma I \\\\ \\dot R &amp;= \\gamma I \\\\ \\dot E &amp;= p I - cE \\end{aligned} \\] Infected persons release pathogen into the environment at rate p. The pathogen decays at rate c. A susceptible host can get infected by contact with contaminated environment at rate b. 7.2.3 Environmental transmission and external drivers Because environmental transmission involves the survival of pathogen for a potentially extended time in the environment, such ID are often more strongly influenced by external drivers compared to ID that are directly transmitted. The weather has often a strong impact, as do behavior changes. E.g. humans living in temparate zones are more likely to swim in lakes when it’s warm, therefore water-borne diseases often have the highest incidence in warm months. Such external drivers can be included in models by allowing certain parameters to vary over time. For instance the transmission rate or the rate at which environmental pathogen decays could be made dependent on the time of the year. 7.3 Summary 7.4 Exercises The Environmental transmission app in the DSAIDE package provides hands-on computer exercises for this chapter. 7.5 References "],

Hosts of one type infect hosts of the other, there is no direct transmission between hosts of the same type. Schematic of a vector-borne ID Not surprisingly, the IDs which receive the most study are those where one of the hosts are humans. The other host (i.e. the vector) can be any other animal, such as dogs, rodents, snails, insects, etc. At times, growth and replication of the pathogen occur mainly in one host, with the other just serving as vessel to get between hosts. Most often, the pathogen completes important parts of its growth and replication cycle in both (or all, if there are more than 2) hosts. 8.1.2 Modeling vector-borne transmission The easiest way to model a vector-borne disease is to simply ignore the vector and assume that the transmission term of the equation (e.g. a term like bSI) represents – in a very simpliefied form – all the complicated processes involved in transmission, including the vector stage. That makes the model simple, but of course doesn’t capture the vector-borne aspects of the dynamics. If we are interested in the dynamics of the disease in all hosts, we do need to include the vector components in a model. To include vectors in a model, one could for instance build 2 SIR-type models, with one set of equations for the (human) host and one for the vector, and then couple the compartments by including transmission from humans to vectors and vectors to humans. Equations for such a model would look as follows: \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\dot S_h &amp;= - \\beta_1 S_h I_v \\\\ \\dot I_h &amp;= \\beta_1S_h I_v - \\gamma_h I_h \\\\ \\dot R_h &amp;= \\gamma_h I_h \\\\ \\dot S_v &amp;= - \\beta_2 S_v I_h \\\\ \\dot I_v &amp;= \\beta_2 S_v I_h - \\gamma_v I_v \\\\ \\dot R_v &amp;= \\gamma_v I_v \\end{aligned} \\] Here, the index h indicates humans and v indicates vectors. The important vector-borne aspect of such a model is that transmission only occurs from hosts to vector and vector to host, not between 2 hosts or 2 vectors. In general, the above model needs to be modified to more accurately describe vector-borne ID dynamics. For instance, many vectors have a fairly short natural lifespan, and as such their births and deaths need to be included in the model, even if the timescale on which we investigate the model is short enough to allow us to ignore births and deaths for humans. It is common to include more details in the human part of the model (e.g. asymptomatic stage and others as discussed previously) and less detail for the vector part. The specific details that should be included are driven by the question one want to to study. 8.2 Summary 8.3 Exercises The Vector transmission app in the DSAIDE package provides hands-on computer exercises for this chapter. 8.4 References "],

We want to implement control and intervention strategies to minimize disease burden. That could be trying to contain an ongoing outbreak, reduce incidence of an endemic disease, or try to completely eradicate a disease. Depending on modes of transmission, infectiousness profiles and other ID characteristics, the types of interventions that are available and potentially effective will vary. Therefore, the better we understand and ID, the better we can likely implement control. 9.3 Goals of ID control When trying to control an ID, we often have more than one goal in mind. The following are a list of (overlapping) public health goals that we often try to achieve with ID control: Reduce morbidity Reduce mortality Reduce transmission Reduce incidence/prevalence Reduce economic impact Minimize ethical or moral dilemmas Protect the individual Protect the population Most of these goals are overlapping. E.g. reducing transmission likely reduces overall morbidity and mortality. Sometimes, goals can be conflicting. For instance if we have limited resources, should we target those that are most likely to transmit but not suffer much from the disease (e.g. children) or target those that are most likely to experience morbidity/mortality but are not that important for transmission (e.g. elderly)? Similarly, at what level is it acceptable to force people to (not) do something (e.g. forced vaccination or quarantine) that might not help - and maybe even slightly hurt - the individual, but will be benefitial to society? Answers to those questions are usually beyond the scope of just ID Epidemiology. What we can contribute to the wider discussion is an assessment of impact of various control strategies. That information can then be combined with other considerations to make decisions. 9.4 Types of infectious disease control The types of control and intervention strategies that exist for a given ID vary. Some depend on the route of transmission, others depend on our skills and ability, e.g. our ability to produce a vaccine. The following sections describe the major types of ID control. 9.4.1 Vaccination Vaccines are arguably the most cost effective public health intervention we have. An ideal vaccine is one that has to only be given once to induce lifelong protection against the ID. It should also be safe, with little to no side effects. Other characteristics of a good vaccine are ease of administration, low price and easy to transport and store. The only IDs we have been able to eradicate so far (smallpox and rinderpest) are those against which we have good vaccines. Unfortunately, a good vaccine alone does not mean eradication is likely. Measles is a good example. We have a good vaccine but the pathogen is so highly transmissible that coverage would need to be at levels beyond those currently achievable. 9.4.2 Pharmaceutical Interventions (Drugs) Drugs, most notably antibiotics, are another very effective means of combating ID. While vaccines try to prevent infection, drugs usually try to prevent symptoms (morbidity and mortality) in already infected individuals. Reduction in symptoms might or might not impact transmission dynamics. A good example where treatment reduces infectiousness and transmission is ART treatment for HIV infected individuals. While not commonly used, drugs can also be given to susceptibles as prophylaxis to reduce the risk of infection. As such, one can think of drugs as short-term vaccines - though the mechanism of protection is very different. Again, HIV is a good example, where pre-exposure prophylaxis with ART has recently been shown to be somewhat effective in reducing risk of infection. For some ID, such as e.g. helminth infections, mass drug treatment is also being used to try and reduce ID prevalence enough to interrupt transmission and potentially eliminate the ID. 9.4.3 Non-pharmaceutical Interventions These are the oldest types of interventions, and are often quite effective. Quarantining of either infected or susceptibles prevents further transmission. Quarantine alone does not help those that are already infected. Though if quarantine occurs in a medical setting, targeted help for the sick might reduce their morbidity and mortality. A prominent recent example for the use of quarantine was during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. No drugs or vaccines were available, and quarantine was the main control strategy. These days, strict quarantine can be hard to enforce, especially for diseases that are not as severe as for instance Ebola. A broader class of intervention strategies, of which quarantine is a strong form, often goes by the name of social distancing interventions. E.g. closing a school to stop an ongoing flu or measles outbreak would usually not be labeled as quarantine, but would be considerd social distancing. In general, social distancing interventions try to reduce opportunities for spread, usually without going as far as fully isolating/quarantining individuals. This makes the intervention both less effective and less restrictive. Finding the right balance between restricting a person’s individual freedoms and protecting society can be difficult. Another non-pharaceutical intervention that has a profound long-term effect is sanitation. By ensuring individuals have access to clean water, and waste is properly disposed of, the incidence of many ID dramatically drops. In fact, for almost all IDs, strong drops were seen in Europe and North America before the introduction of antibiotics - simply due to better living conditions. While usually not considered ID interventions, general improvement in health (e.g. better nutrition), living conditions (e.g. better housing) and health literacy (better education) are known to be very effective at reducing the burden of any disease. Unfortunately, such systemic interventions are among the hardest to achieve. 9.4.4 Special interventions for non-human hosts If one of the hosts is not a human (e.g. a mosquito vector, or some other animal), it is possible to use interventions that are not feasible for humans. Widespread killing of mosquitoes is ethically acceptable (though often not too effective). Killing of mammals, e.g. culling of dogs in certain parts of the world to prevent spread of rabies or other diseases, is more controversial. For some animals, ethical concerns are usually not too great (e.g. killing of poultry), but economic implications can be huge. 9.5 Characteristics of interventions In addition to grouping interventions into specific classes as done above, it is also useful to think about them in terms of their overall characteristics. Temporal/timing characteristics: While some interventions are permanent or long-term, e.g. vaccines, sanitation, improved living standards, other interventions are short-term, such as drug treatment or quarantine. In general, those interventions with lasting effects are preferable. However, those are also often the most expensive and difficult to implement. Target group characteristics: Another way to distinguish ID interventions is by target group. Vaccines are ideally given before someone becomes infected with the ID. Drugs on the other hand are usually given to infected persons (though pre-exposure prophylaxis is sometimes used, e.g. for HIV or for flu during a pandemic). Quarantine can be applied to either susceptibles or infected. Measures such as sanitation improvement affect everyone. Impact level characteristics: By that, I refer to the primary target being the individual or the population. The primary goal of drugs is to help the individual - population level effects as discussed earlier are secondary. In contrast, quarantine primarily targets population level impacts. It might not help an individual infected host if they are quarantined (though ethically, they should receive whatever support can be provided). Vaccines are also primarily meant to help protect the individual getting the vaccine. However, the effect of good vaccines is so powerful that in planning vaccination strategies, secondary population level effects due to herd immunity are nowadays taken into account. Interventions such as sanitation almost always target whole populations (e.g. a village/town/country). Of course, for many interventions, these categories are not clear-cut and overlap. Still, it is conceptually useful to think about interventions in such broad categories. By looking at all the tools available and assessing their impact and feasibility, one can try to come up with the best strategy for a given ID and scenario. Such a best strategy will often involve using more than one method. 9.6 Impact of Interventions We discussed previously that to eradicate a disease (or prevent local outbreaks) one has to get the effective reproductive number to just a bit below 1 (of course the lower and closer to 0, the better). The level of population protection at which R=1 is called critical herd/population immunity level. The relation between original/basic reproductive number, intervention coverage and effective R is R= R0(1-p). That’s true if we assume that the intervention fully protects those to whom it is applied. If instead the intervention is not perfect, we have R=R0(1-e*p), where e is the effectiveness of the intervention (e=1 is a perfectly effective intervention). By discussing intervention coverage, we assumed that the intervention was applied to the susceptibles. However, the same idea also aplies if the intervention is applied to infected. Recall that the reproductive number is given by \\(R = D \\beta S\\). Reducing the fraction of susceptibles by some intervention reduces R. But we can also reduce R by reducing the duration of the infectious period, D, or the infectiousness/rate at which an infected transmits, \\(\\beta\\). Quarantining infected is a strategy to reduce \\(\\beta\\), drugs sometimes can reduce D and \\(\\beta\\). For instance, if we can reduce the duration of the infectious period in the average infected person by p, we get a new effective reproductive number \\(R_{e} = D(1-p) \\beta S\\). Obviously, the best strategy is one where we reduce duration of infection, transmissibility and number of susceptibles by some fraction, thus leading to a potentially large reduction in R. 9.7 Interventions and Models Studying the potential impact of interventions is probably the single most important current use of ID models. It is often simply not possible to do field studies or experiments to test the impact of specific intervention strategies. Such field studies would take long, be very costly, be logistically hard to do, and be often simply unethical: We can’t introduce Ebola into a population, just to see how effective different intervention strategies might be! Thus, we rely on modeling to investigate hypothetical scenarios. Models are relatively easy and quick to build and analyze (at least compared to real field studies), there are no ethical problems, and we have ‘full control’ over the whole system and ‘know everything’. The hope is that if our models are decent approximations of the real world, we can make informed decisions and prepare for future outbreaks. 9.8 Summary 9.9 Exercises The 9.10 References "],

We assumed that in all other respects, hosts are similar enough with regard to features that matter for ID dynamics and control that we did not have to consider them. That is of course at best a good approximation and at worst completely wrong. There are many characteristics that can affect how an ID interacts with a host. For instance for many ID, children and the elderly are more likely to get infected and might suffer more severe symptoms. For other ID, only specific groups are affected. For instance, only sexually active individuals are at risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (ignoring for a moment less common transmission routes such as e.g. blood transfusion for HIV). We will discuss some of these differences/heterogeneities between hosts and how they affect ID transmission and control in this module. 10.3 Types of host heterogeneity We generally only care about differences in hosts as they relate to the infectious disease process. Consider a simple - maybe silly - example: Almost no infectious disease study (none that I know of) cares about a person’s eye color. That’s because this characteristic has - as far as we know - no effect on the interaction of host and ID. On the other hand, a very important characteristic that affects many IDs is age, and is therefore often taken into account when studying IDs. Other important broad categories that affect ID infection and spread are genetics and behavior. Some differences in hosts might only affect a single component of the ID, e.g. the level of susceptibility to infection. Other host differences can affect multiple components, e.g. a sexually highly active person is more likely to contract an STI and more likely to transmit if they are infected. 10.3.1 Host heterogeneity examples There are several famous examples that show how differences in genetics impact ID. For instance persons with a certain mutation of the CCR5 co-receptor on T-cells are much less likely to get infected with HIV. Similarly, persons with a specific mutation in the FUT2 gene are much less likely to get infected with norovirus. It is likely that there are genetic differences for almost any ID that influence the probability of getting infected, the severity of symptoms, and the duration and amount of shedding. 10.4 Heterogeneity in transmission - core groups For the purpose of studying ID transmission dynamics, differences in the potential and ability of individual hosts to spread an ID are obviously of great importance. This idea of heterogeneity in transmission has been studied in several contexts and under different names. One of the first ideas was the concept of a core group, which was first introduced for gonorrhea in the 1970s (see e.g. (Yorke, Hethcote, and Nold 1978)). Core groups are subgroups in which transmission is higher compared to other groups. For many STI, transmission in the general population is low enough that the reproductive number is below 1. The question then is, why does that not lead to extinction of the ID? The answer is the core-group concept. There are small subgroups of individuals in which the ID has a reproductive number that is greater than 1. It can thus maintain itself in that population and from there continue to enter the general population. Once we have identified that different groups have different transmission behavior, it also becomes important to understand how individuals belonging to one of the groups interact with individuals of the other groups. This is often called the mixing pattern between groups. We are most interested in the mixing and contact patterns that facilitate transmission for the ID under consideration. For instance it is well known that humans tend to have more contacts with others of the same age, e.g. chidren predominanly contacting other children. This is called assortative mixing and such age-specific mixing is important for the transmission of many respiratory diseases. The opposite is disassortative mixing. For instance for STI, most mixing occurs between individuals from the opposite sex (and there are also more contacts among individuals of similar age). If there is no mixing preference, it is called random mixing. 10.5 Heterogeneity in transmission - superspreaders An equivalent concept to that of the core group, but applied to individuals, is known by the term superspreaders. Superspreaders are individuals who spread/transmit an ID much more than the average infected person. It turns out that for most ID, the number of secondary transmissions produced by the average infected person is not too meaningful. Such a measure would be a good description if the distribution of secondary infections were close to normal (or poisson), with most infected individuals infecting similar numbers of others. However, what is often observed is a heavily skewed distribution, with most individuals infecting none or only a few others, and a few individuals infecting many others (Galvani and May 2005). 10.6 Heterogeneity and the reproductive number I already aluded to this above: If we have multiple host types, we need to extend the idea of the reproductive number. While it is possible to compute a reproductive number for the overall population, this quantity might not tell the full story. Instead, we might want to look at the reproductive number for subsets of the population, for instance for the general population (non-superspreaders) and core groups (the superspreaders). 10.7 Heterogeneity and ID control Heterogeneity among hosts with respect to their susceptibility, infectiousness and severity has direct implications for control. If we know who is most likely to transmit, who is most likely to have a severe case of a disease, and who is most likely to catch and ID in the first place, we can implement targeted control strategies. Instead of for instance vaccinating people at random, we could target those that are most vulnerable to getting the ID, or those most likely to infect others if they were to get infected. The better we can target the intervention, the more impact they can have, we get more ‘bang for our buck’. 10.8 Modeling Heterogeneity The basic concept of including host heterogeneity in models is fairly simple. We split/stratify the population according to the characteristic we want to take into account. For instance instead of lumping everyone into susceptible-infected-recovered categories, we can track males and females, or children and adults, separately. Example of including host heterogeneity in an SIR model. The challenges with including more details in the model are not conceptual but instead logistical and potentially technical. Bigger models are harder to write, more difficult to analyze, and we need estimates for each model parameter, which are often hard to get. Because of that, it is often best to start with a simple model, and slowly introduce more host characteristics as they are deemed important for the ID setting and question one wants to address. At some point, if we want to include a lot of detail, it might be worth switching the modeling framework. For compartmental models, hosts are grouped together according to characteristics. As we want to track more characteristics, the number of compartments we need to include increases. If the basic model has C compartments/variables, P parameters, and we model N subpopulations, we have C x N equations, and at least P x N (or more) parameters. For instance if we had a basic SEIR model (4 compartments), and wanted to track males and females in 4 different age groups, we had 4 x 2 x 4 = 32 compartments. Add to that possible extra stratifications according to say vaccination or treatment status, and one can easily end up with models of 50 or even more than 100 compartments. It might then be worth deciding to stop using compartmental models and instead switch to a type of model that is called agent or individual based model (ABM/IBM). In such models, each individual host is modeled and tracked individually. We can give everyone as many different characteristics as we want. This makes the model very flexible and potentially very realistic. The downside of these ABM is that they tend to be complex, harder to program, take a long time to run. Further, for detailed models lots of parameter estimates are needed and they are often not available, leading to potentially large uncertainty in model predictions. Also, it is hard to do any kind of statistal inference with ABM. Because of these disadvantages, the compartmental modeling framework is still the most frequently used one and a good starting point for most situations and questions. For ID where we know a lot and want detailed predictions (e.g. influenza), ABM are becoming more common. 10.9 References References "],

The complicated bits are to properly model any potential interactions between IDs. Example of a model that considers 2 ID. As mentioned previously, more compartments means bigger models. Those are harder to write, more difficult to analyze, and we need estimates for each model parameter, which are often hard to get. Because of that, considering/modeling more than 2 ID is still almost never done - but many important 2-ID modeling studies exist. 11.6 Summary 11.7 Exercises The Multi-pathogen dynamics app in the DSAIDE package provides hands-on computer exercises for this chapter. 11.8 References "],

A special focus is given on the potential of ID extinction. 12.2 Determinisic models So far, all the models we have used to explore different aspects of ID dynamics have been deterministic. For a deterministic model, once you choose the initial conditions and parameter values, you always get the same result, no matter how often you run the model. There is no randomness present. Such deterministic models are fairly easy to implement and to study. That is one reason why they are often used. Such a modeling approach also often provides a good representation of the dynamics of real ID if numbers are large. That is due to the law of large numbers. While every individual host or pathogen undergoes somewhat random dynamics, these random parts get averaged out and the dynamics for the whole population is fairly predictable and well described by such deterministic models. (This is the same concept we use in classical epidemiological studies, where we enroll large enough numbers such that we can say something predictable about differences between groups, even if individuals are somewhat unpredictable.) 12.3 Stochasticity Biological systems are never deterministic. When numbers are low, randomness starts to matter. As an example, consider an outbreak of some ID. Let’s say we have a group of 100 infected. At a given time, some of them will transmit to others and after that they will recover from the disease, while others will recover before being able to further infect others. The overall outbreak dynamics can be well approximated by a deterministic model if we properly specify the average rate of transmission and the average rate of recovery. In contrast, now assume that there is a single infected person. It makes a huge difference if this person first transmits to someone else before recovering, or if they recover before further transmitting. In the latter case, the outbreak is over and the ID has gone extinct. Thus, at low numbers, randomness/unpredictability in the order of events can make a large difference. 12.4 Discrete numbers and Extinctions Another problem inherent in the deterministic differential equation based models we have looked at so far is that they treat individuals in each compartment as continuous. The models allow for instance 142.7 infected hosts. Of course, in reality those numbers have to be integers. If we are dealing with large numbers, this difference between 142.7 and 142 or 143 is minor and doesn’t matter. However, once numbers get small, the fact that we are dealing with discrete numbers of hosts matters. Most importantly, if less than 1 host is infected, it means in reality the ID is gone. A continuous model would instead allow the number of infected to drop below 1 but still remain above 0. In this way, the ID in the continuous models never goes truly extinct, it only gets closer and closer to 0 (and at some point is so close to 0 that the computer can’t distinguish it from 0 anymore). 12.5 Modeling Stochasticity and Extinction To capture both the randomness and discrete nature of real systems, a slightly different modeling approach is needed. We can still use compartmental models, i.e. we track total numbers of individuals in specific states (e.g. S-I-R). But now, instead of letting the numbers in each compartment change continuously through inflows and outflows, changes happen in discrete steps, determined by specific events that occur in a probabilistic manner. As an example, instead of new susceptible hosts entering the system at some continuous birth rate, we now model births occuring as discrete events. Each birth event leads to an increase in the number of susceptibles by 1. The timing of the birth events is somewhat random, with overall probability determined by the model (e.g. a higher birth rate will mean births occur more frequent, but still randomly.) 12.6 Factors affecting extinction Extinction of ID is of interest because that is often our final goal. We would like to drive an ID to extinction, either locally or even better, globally. If and how an ID can be driven to extinction depends on different factors. First, for human ID, the only real chance is to tackle IDs for which there are no other hosts. As such, we will likely never be able to eradicate influenza. But measles eradication might be possible (though hard). Several factors influence the likelihood of an ID to go extinct. The size of the host population and speed at which resources (i.e. new susceptible hosts) are replenished are important factors. So are the infectiousness of the ID, the duration of the latent and infectious periods, the ability of the ID to persist outside the host, etc. 12.7 Critical community size The minimum size of a population at which an ID can maintain itself in a population without extinction has been termed Critical Community Size (CCS) (this also depends on the replenishment of new susceptibles, e.g. birth rates). Studies for measles suggested that the CCS was several hundred thoushand (Matt J Keeling and Grenfell 2002), meaning that measles could have only become a human pathogen once human populations were large enough to maintain the ID. The CCS is with reference to the susceptible population. Thus, it is possible to reduce a community size by for instance vaccinating. That means that to get an ID to go extinct, it is not necessary to vaccinate everyone. We just need to reach enough individuals to get the population of susceptibles below the critical level. This task is already hard by itself, as evidenced by the fact that we have not been able to eradicate measles, despite having a good vaccine. 12.8 Host extinction Another way an ID can go extinct is if its hosts go extinct - either due to mortality from the ID or other causes. For most human diseases, such host extinction is fortunately not very common - though highly lethal ID such as Ebola can lead to marked reduction in the number of hosts in a given population. For non-human disease, extinctions of hosts due to disease is a more important issue. Here, conversation efforts might try to achieve non-extinction of the host and - ideally - extinction of the ID. 12.9 References References "],

Microorganisms, especially viruses, tend to undergo rapid evolutionary change. High mutation rates and large population sizes provide many opportunities for the generation of genotypic and phenotypic diversity. Short generation times and fluctuations in population size (e.g. through transmission bottlenecks) allow selection to quickly act on this diversity, amplifying those mutants that have a fitness advantage and eliminating those with low fitness. These features of microbial populations leads to often rapid evolutionary change. Such evolutionary change can become a public health problem. In the following sections, we briefly discuss several drivers of public health importance that influence the selective fitness of different genetic variants and thereby drive ID evolution. 13.3 Evolution of immunity or vaccine escape A very strong driver of evolution is the host immune response. If an ID induces a strong immune response which subsequently protects the host from re-infection, a mutant of the ID which can partially escape the host immunity and infect a host will have a large fitness advantage. This is the process which drives the continuous evolution of influenza in humans. A similar process occurs if immunity is created through vaccines. This again is behind the reason we need to get re-immunized with influenza vaccines regularly. 13.4 Evolution of drug resistance Drugs are another mechanism that applies a strong selective pressure. Any pathogen that can avoid being killed by a drug can potentially ‘take over’ a patient and transmit to the next. If drug use is widespread in the population, those resistant mutants - which generally have lower fitness than the wild-type, drug sensitive strain - can take over in a population. This phenomenon has been observed with many different ID and drugs and produced such looming public health problems as extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB) and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Since viruses tend to evolve faster than bacteria, drug resistance evolution is often a problem at the individual patient level. HIV is the prime example. Single-drug therapy for HIV fails consistently because the virus quickly evolved resistance. Only once we started using multiple drugs at the same time were we able to prevent rapid evolution - basically by playing a ‘numbers game’ - the chance of 3 resistance mutations against 3 different drugs occuring is so small that it rarely happens during the treatment of an individual host, thus making the drugs effective for the host’s lifetime. 13.5 Evolution of Virulence The term virulence is a bit fuzzy, it generally means ‘harm to the host’. That could be due to mortality caused by an ID, or in less severe forms, ID related morbidity (sickness/symptoms). Pathogens ‘don’t care’ about harming their hosts, their main ‘purpose’ is to get in, replicate, and get back out and infect the next host. Sometimes, inducing some morbidity in the host is useful for the pathogen, e.g. sneezing and coughing for respiratory infections might lead to enhanced transmission and therefore increased pathogen fitness. In other situations, inducing morbidity/mortality doesn’t increase pathogen fitness, but it also doesn’t decrease it. Therefore, selection doesn’t act to change the amount of symptoms induced. Pathogens that are too virulent, and in extreme cases kill their hosts, generally have reduced fitness since in most situations, dead hosts do not transmit. The idea is then that pathogens evolve to induce the level of virulence that is optimal for their overall transmission fitness. 13.6 Evolution and public health interventions In general (apart from the possible phenomenon of drug-induced hypermutation in bacteria), the generation of genetic variants is not influenced by any human interventions. Those mutants are produced constantly. In the usual setting, most mutants are less fit than the wild-type strain and therefore are outcompeted - if not, they replace the current strain and become the new wild-type. What happens in the presence of interventions is that the fitness landscape changes. FOr instance if we give a patient drugs, a mutant resistant to drugs - with fitness less than the wild-type in the absence of drug treatment - has a major advantage and can outcompete the wild-type strain. 13.7 Co-evolution While the hosts infected by ID also evolve, this usually happens on much slower time-scales. As such, studying evolution by assuming only the ID evolves and not the host is often a good approximation. However, there are examples where host evolution needs to be considered. A good example is the introduction of myxomavirus into australian rabbits. Evolution of both the virus and rabbits was observed. Over longer time-scales, features such as sickle cell anemia, which comes from a mutation that is associated with reduced malaria morbidity, is likely a trait some humans evolved in response to malaria. 13.8 Modeling evolutionary dynamics To study evolutionary dynamics, we will need to implement models that allow for changes in the system on top of the non-evolutionary dynamics of the ID. Unless we plan to model many different potential new variants, it is often easiest to pre-specify the number of variants we want to track. In the simplest form where we only track pathogen evolution, we might model the wild-type (normal, pre-existing) form of the pathogen and a single mutant that is different in some important characteristic, e.g. resistant to a drug or able to evade a vaccine. We would build a model with these compartments. We often also pre-specify the characteristics (i.e. the parameter values) for both the wild-type and mutant. We implement the process of mutant generation in the model, and run the simulation. Under certain circumstances, we might see the mutant be generated and take over the population. If we want to model many different mutants, maybe allowing for random, not pre-specified, differences in their fitness, and maybe even allowing for host evolution, the models get quite a bit more complicated. They are not necessarily conceptually harder, but there is more bookkeeping and coding involved, which makes it technically trickier. 13.9 Summary 13.10 Exercises The 13.11 References "],

Those could be very close and clearly defined connections, such as for sexually transmitted infections, or much less well defined connections, such as a shared water or air source (e.g. cholera and influenza). If we want to explicitly account for these connections, we need to consider a conceptual framework that moves away from the compartmental approach. In the compartmental approach, all hosts with given characteristics (e.g. infected children) were lumped together and no notion of connectivity was included. In contrast, a network perspective explicitly considers individuals and their connections. 14.3 Network terminology The basic building blocks of networks are entities and their connections. Those entities go by different, equivalent names, such as actor, node, vertex, site. Similarly, the connections have different, equivalent names, such as edge, link, bond, tie or connection. The different names stem from the fact that network ideas were developed independently in different scientific sub-fields. Simple network diagram 14.4 Network nodes Usually, the nodes are individual hosts (e.g. humans). But that does not need to be the case, nodes can also represent entities such as schools, cities, hospitals, etc. Simple networks only have one type of node, more complicated networks can have different types of nodes. For instance humans can be connected to specific places where they meet. In their simplest form, nodes are only characterized by their connections, they don’t have any other properties. In model simulations, it is possible to give nodes features such as age, gender, etc. and account for that when simulating ID spread. 14.5 Network connections What constitutes a connection in a network strongly depends on the question asked and the ID under consideration. Sexual networks connect people that have some form of sexual contact that suffices to transmit the disease in question. Similarly, social contact networks consider contacts between people in a social setting that allows for transmission of an ID, e.g. close contact for transmission of a respiratory disease. Proximity networks can be built based on people frequenting the same locations. Connections can either just ‘exist’ or not, or they can have characteristics, similary to nodes. For instance connections can have weights, with stronger connections between people that have closer or longer contacts. Connections can also have directions. For instance if we wanted to model cholera transmission and had a network of villages, then a village upstream would have a connection pointing to villages downstream, but not the reverse. In other words, an ‘infected village’ upstream can infect a downstream village, but the opposite does not occur. More complex network diagram showing different types of nodes and connections. 14.6 Network characteristics The initial study of a network often starts with the properties of the network itself, without considering any ID spread (yet). One of the most important characteristics of a network is the degree distribution of the nodes. This is simply a histogram of the number of connections that each node has. If connections have directions or there is more than one type of connection possible, then each one would have its own histogram. Another network characteristic is the ‘shortest path length’, which measures the shortest distance of going from a specific node to some other node. Every node has a shortest path length to every other node (if 2 nodes are not connected because they belong to unconnected subparts of a network, the path length is considered infinite). Many other network characteristics exist, the field of network analysis has grown rapidly in the last several years. If you want to learn more, (Newman 2013) is a good resource. Many review articles on that topic also exist, e.g. (Matt J. Keeling and Eames 2005). It is important to understand that some characteristics are attached to individual nodes and some to the full network. For instance every node has a number of degrees (connections) and the network has an overall degree distribution. Similarly, one can compute the mean shortest path length for each node and, if one takes another mean, a mean path length for the whole network. 14.7 Important types of networks There are several types or classes of networks with specific characteristics that have been studied in great detail, either because they are analytically tractable or because of their real world importance. One of the best-studied network is the random network. In this network, any 2 nodes have a fixed probability of being connected. For a network of N nodes and connection probability p, the average number of connections each node has (i.e. it’s degree) is (N-1)p. The degree distribution of the network is binomial, which for large networks becomes a normal distribution. That means most nodes have approximately the average number of connections, there are only few nodes with substantially fewer or more connections. Many real-world networks do not have the degree distribution found for random networks. It is often common that most nodes have very few connections, while a few nodes have many connections. This idea for instance underlies the superspreader concept. Such a distribution of connections can be well described by a scale-free network, here, the degree distribution follows a power law, with most nodes having very few connections but a small number of nodes having very many connections. Random and scale-free networks and degree distribution. 14.8 ID transmission on networks The premise for ID transmission is that it can only occur along the connections of a network. As such, the structure of the network can strongly influence the dynamics of the ID. How exactly different characteristics of networks, such as the one discussed above and others, interact with the characteristics of the ID to affect overall ID dynamics is an area that is currently heavily investigated. For some recent work on that, see e.g. (Bansal, Grenfell, and Meyers 2007). 14.9 Networks and ID control Knowing about the connection structure is important for ID control. Most obviously, if we know who the individuals are with many connections, we could target them preferrentially and have a potentially larger impact compared to targeting random individuals. Other individuals, e.g. those that connect separate clusters of a network, might also be prime targets. The challenge in real world systems is to identify the individuals that should be targeted and being able to reach them - and in an outbreak situation, that would need to be done under time pressure. As such, while network theory has much to offer for control, it is still challenging to implement network-based intervention approaches in practice. 14.10 Modeling ID transmission on networks Building and analyzing network models of ID transmission is generally more challenging than the compartmental modeling approach. For networks, we usually track individuals. As such the models become what are called individual or agent-based models. We need to keep track and simulate the dynamics of each individual. That makes coding harder and running the models much more computationally resource intensive. It is also somewhat harder to analyze the results. Still, networks are much closer to many real systems and have therefore seen increased use in the ID modeling community in recent years. With an increase in available data of the ‘network type’ (e.g. geocoded cellphone data), further increase in computational power and more sophisticated and efficient analysis approaches, it is quite likely that network-based approaches will continue to grow in importance. 14.11 ID transmission on dynamic networks Most of the time, networks are considered static and do not change during the ID transmission process. However, this does not have to be the case and is often not realistic. The most detailed models allow for changes in the network through the making and breaking of connections and addition and loss (e.g. birth and death) of nodes. Implementing and analyzing models that have a dynamically changing network with the ID dynamics (and potential control measures) occuring ‘on top’ is technically challenging. Not too many of such models currently exist, but it is an area of active investigation by many, see e.g. (Bansal et al. 2010). 14.12 Summary 14.13 Exercises The 14.14 References "]
